    <h3>Annual Expected Benefit</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Annual expected benefits from mangroves for flood protection represents the predicted flood damages avoided to people and infrastructure by keeping mangroves intact. It is an annualized benefit metric that considers local factors such as mangrove presence, coastal topography, asset distribution, and storm frequency.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits from Catastrophic Storms</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">More than 30 years of historical data on regional sea level, wave, and storm conditions were used to estimate flooding for 1 in 25, 1 in 50, and 1 in 100 year storm events. For each storm event, a model was used to propagate waves from offshore to nearshore and inland areas to obtain flood extents and heights. The “With Mangroves” scenario used a higher friction coefficient for areas with 
mangroves. The “Without Mangroves” scenario used a lower friction coefficient assuming all mangroves are converted (lost) to open water.

    <h3>People Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">This value represents the difference of flooding impacts on people when mangroves are present and when they are absent. Population and demographic data came from the <a href='https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/' target='_blank'><b>JRC-EU Global Human Settlement Layer</b><a> and the Jamaica National Census (2011).</p>
    
    <h3>Built Capital Protected</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">This value represents the difference of flood impacts on built capital when mangroves are present and when they are absent. This value is aggregated to the country scale from 90m resolution data.</p>
